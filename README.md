## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Data Analyst** who believes every dataset hides a story — it just needs the right questions (and a few cleaning steps) to tell it.
My daily routine involves transforming raw, messy information into clean insights, designing models that make sense of chaos, and crafting dashboards that actually *talk back*.

I’m passionate about uncovering patterns, simplifying complex data, and creating visuals that make decision-making effortless.

## 💼 What I Do

* 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – because good analysis starts with tidy data.
* 🧩 **Data Modeling** – building relationships and logic that keep everything connected.
* 📊 **Dashboard Design & Reporting** – visual storytelling using Power BI & Excel.
* 🗣️ **Data Storytelling** – helping stakeholders see the *why* behind the numbers.

## 😄 Fun Fact

I once spent hours debugging a dataset… only to realize the issue was a single invisible space.
Since then, I’ve learned two things:

1. Never underestimate whitespace.
2. Coffee is the ultimate debugging tool ☕.
